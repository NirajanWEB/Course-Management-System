# Course Management System

 <p>Java based project where student can choose different courses.</p>
 <b>Features of CMS:</b>
 
Consider a course registration system for a college. Students are expected to register for the course
of study of their choice. Additionally, an administrator at the college does occasionally add new
courses to the list of available ones for students to have a wider selection of courses. It is possible
for an administrator to cancel a course if it is no longer being offered. A cancelled course might be
available at another time. However, when a course becomes unpopular, it is deleted altogether and
cannot be reactivated at a later date. A deleted course is permanently removed from the list of
courses at the college.

An example course of study is BSc in Computer Science. Courses are delivered on a semester basis,
with each semester having 4 modules that students must study, a total of 8 modules altogether to
complete a year of study.

An instructor is assigned up to 4 modules across the different levels of study. Students in levels 4 and
5 have no optional modules; however in level 6, students have two electives and 2 mandatorymodules. To proceed between levels, a student must pass half of the modules for the current level.
A pass mark constitutes a score of at least 40% on assessed work for the module.

# Users of the system

<b>Students – </b>a student is a key stakeholder of this system as they choose courses, and enroll for
modules on that course. At level 6, the student is also able to select from some optional courses
during semesters 1 and 2. Students also are able to view which instructor(s) are teaching on the
modules they are studying.

<b>Course administrator</b> – they can add new courses, add modules to a course, cancel a course, or
delete a course altogether. They also are responsible for edits/amendments of course names,
module names, etc. An administrator is able to generate a report/result slip for a student depicting
modules done for the semester or year of study, and the marks and grades for each module. Based
on this, there is decision appended to the result slip indicating whether a student will progress to
next level of study or not.

<b>Instructor</b> – they are assigned modules to teach, can view what modules they are on, and the
students registered on those modules. Instructors are able to add marks to each module they are
responsible for teaching.

# Key features required of the system

• Ability to amend courses and modules.

• Ability to amend instructor details or to remove instructors from modules.

• Ability to produce a result slip for each student indicating their grades on each module

• Persistence of data – all data is saved between program invocations

Additionally, there should be evidence of application of object oriented concepts, such as
inheritance, encapsulation, object associations and polymorphism.
